# Professional Portfolio

## Description
I created this site both to bolster and demonstrate my budding skills using CSS and HTML and to have a place where I can display my web development projects as I create them!

Coding this also gave me the opportunity to practice good web design in a number of ways. I followed a template, and used HTML to create a basic framework for said template; this gave me experience creating a site from scratch based on a given model, and also exemplified the core structure of many modern sites. I also used a number of flexboxes, paired with media queries, to make it so that my site will reformat itself based on screen size. This gave me ample practice in formatting different parts of a website using different flexbox techniques. In addition, I used the WAVE acecssibility tool to check to ensure my site would be accessible and navigable for anyone. 

I plan to update this in the future with each new project I would like to showcase.
